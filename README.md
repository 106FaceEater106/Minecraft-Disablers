A list of known Minecraft Anticheat Disablers, this is mostly so the Dev's of the Anticheats know how to patch them.

Current Disablers:
Kauri (Is gonna get patched soon), 
OnlyMC Works infinitely,
Cold Network Disabler (Works for abt 2 minutes and then kicks you to the lobby, staff alerts, no ban),
Redesky 'Disabler' allows you to vanilla fly up and down infinitely.
